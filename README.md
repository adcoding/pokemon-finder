![Pokémon Search App](./public/cover-img.png)

### Description
This is a simple Pokémon search web application built with React that utilizes the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data on Pokémon. Users can search for any Pokémon by name, and the app will display a card with relevant information, including the Pokémon's image, stats, and a brief description.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: Allows users to enter a Pokémon name or ID.
- **Pokémon Card**: Displays Pokémon details including an image, type, basic stats (like HP, Attack, Defense), and a short description.
- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Powered by the PokéAPI, the app retrieves live data to display up-to-date Pokémon information.
